    """ 
    Function that finds artefacts caused by increasing/reducing 
    stimulation from 0 to 1mA without ramp.
    For correct functioning, the external data recording should
    start in stim-off, and typically short pulses are given 
    (without ramping). 
    This function uses a fixed threshold ('thresh_external'), which
    has to be adapted to each data recorder in the config.json file. 
    The signal must be pre-processed previously with a high-pass 
    Butterworth filter (1Hz) to ensure removal of slow drifts
    and offset around 0.

    Inputs:
        - data: single external channel as np.ndarray (from bipolar electrode)
        - sf_external (int): sampling frequency of external recording
        - ignore_first_seconds_external : if given, the first n-seconds
            will be ignored (back-up, in case recording was started with stim ON, 
            or if there are huge artefacts in the beginning)
        - consider_first_seconds_external : if given, only artefacts in
            the first (and last) n-seconds are considered (in case the
            recording is StimON, it ignores the other amplitude changes)
    
    Returns:
