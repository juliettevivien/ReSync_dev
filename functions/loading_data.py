# Function to open TMSi data

def _load_TMSi_artefact_channel(

):
    
	"""
	Function that takes a poly5 object and returns in an array the channel 
	which will be used for sync ("BIP 01" in our settings),	and in another 
	array the timescale in milliseconds of the TMSi recording. It also prints 
	information about the recording (duration, channels, sampling frequency,...)
	
	Input:
		- TMSi_data : TMSiFileFormats.file_readers.poly5reader.Poly5Reader

	Returns:
		- TMSi_channel (np.ndarray with shape (y,)): the channel of the external 
            recording to be used for alignment (the one containing deep brain 
            stimulation artefacts = the channel recorded with the bipolar 
            electrode, y datapoints)
        - TMSi_file (np.ndarray with shape: (x, y)): the external recording 
            containing all recorded channels (x channels, y datapoints)
		- external_rec_ch_names (list of x names): the names of all the channels 
            recorded externally
		- sf_external (int): sampling frequency of external recording
