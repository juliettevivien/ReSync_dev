    This function is used to crop the external recording and the
    intracerebral recording one second before the first artefact
    detected. The end of the longest one of those two recordings
    is also cropped, to have the same duration for the two recordings.
    The two cropped recordings are saved as .csv files.

    Inputs:
        - LFP_array (np.ndarray with shape: (x, y)): the intracerebral recording 
            containing all recorded channels (x channels, y datapoints)
        - external_file (np.ndarray with shape: (x, y)): the external recording 
            containing all recorded channels (x channels, y datapoints)
        - art_time_LFP (float): the timepoint when the artefact starts in the intracerebral 
            recording (found previously using the function find_LFP_sync_artefact)
        - art_time_BIP (float): the timepoint when the artefact starts in the external 
            recording (found previously using the function find_external_sync_artefact)
        - LFP_rec_ch_names (list of x names): the names of all the channels 
            recorded intracerebrally (to rename the cropped recording accordingly)
        - external_rec_ch_names (list of x names): the names of all externally recorded channels 
            (to rename the cropped recording accordingly)
        - real_art_time_LFP (float): default 0, but can be changed in notebook via 
            interactive plotting to adjust artefact detection
        - sf_LFP (int): sampling frequency of intracranial recording
        - sf_external (int): sampling frequency of external recording


    Returns:
        - LFP_df_offset2 (np.ndarray with shape: (x, y2)): the cropped intracerebral 
            recording with all its recorded channels
        - external_df_offset2 (np.ndarray with shape: (x, y2)): the cropped external 
            recording with all its recorded channels
